# Project Battleship

Built by Jefferson Ostler
IS 542 - Web Development Final Semester Project

### Description

Project Battleship is a completely functional React.js Battleship 2 player game. The players would need to be at the same computer in order to play against each other. It was not within the project's scope (or my knowledge) to build out a server for two remote individuals to duel each other. I decided to make this my semester project when, for an interview, I was asked to build the logic out for a Minesweeper game (the one with the exploding bombs). That interview showed me how to manipulate a grid and update it based on user input, so the idea for this battleship game was born. I added some fun in-game "analytics" for fun.

I am very proud of what I have built as it demonstrates both my ability with software and creativity to make something completely original and functional.

### Architecture

The project is built entirely in React.js. For this project I focused primarily on the logic portion of the code. I made the user design sleek and simple. The majority of the setup and game logic is controlled in the <Game> component, which lives close to the top of the component heirarchy. The game setup logic makes up roughly 75% of all of the apps logic, which was surprising to me
Style of the grid squares is manipulated through object.

### What I learned
I learned loads.
- I learned how to better design a build on paper before actually going and touching the keyboard.
- I learned to receive feedback from users and make modifications accordingly.
- I learned how to design and build in small sprints.
- I learned about the importance of the console.
- I learned that I can do this! It was awesome to build something like this, that pushed me and expanded my limits.
- I learned how to let the project evolve over time and be able to adjust in changes to initial thoughts and plans.
- I learned to have fun and rejoice when things worked!
- I learned how easy it is to publish and deploy to github pages :)

### Future Modificiations
For the future I want to see if I can make this a server-based remote game, where to random people can join a room, create a session and play head-to-head battleship while not being at the same computer.
Styling and user friendliness would be enhanced.
Fix the fade effect.
